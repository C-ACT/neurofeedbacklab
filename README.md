# Neurofeedbacklab

A Neurofeedback software approach based on Matlab. There is no visual programming language, so it is only sutable for those who do not fear source code and the command line.

# Dependencies

- Matlab (including student versions)
- EEGLAB from https://eeglab.org
  - After installing EEGLAB, install the following plugins from the EEGLAB plugin manage (menu item File > Manage extension)
  - Update the clean_rawdata plugin to version 2.5 or later. This is used for real time Artifact Subspace Reconstruction
  - PICARD if you want to do real time Independent Component Analysis
  - ROICONNECT if you want to do real time eLoreta and connectivity analysis from https://github.com/arnodelorme/roiconnect
- LSL install released code from https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/liblsl-Matlab (install the zip release which contains binary)
- Matlab psychophysics toolbox http://psychtoolbox.org/ if you want visual feedback

# Features

- Stream real time EEG signal using LSL and process it in real time
- Compute measure of interest, provide visual feedback or stream results through TCP/IP connection to other program.
- In a typical use, the same computer runs the data acquisition and performs visual feedback. 
- Adaptive filtering with minimum phase distortion
- Automated artifact rejection using Artifact Subspace Reconstruction. This methods uses PCA to find artifactual sections of data, then reconstruct a clean signal based on the statistics of the basline. https://sccn.ucsd.edu/~scott/pdf/Mullen_BCI13.pdf
- Apply spatial filter (independent component analysis)
- Spectral decomposition - tapered FFT - and selection of frequency bands of interest
- Save raw data and all transformed measures (spectral decomposition, feedback) in Matlab files for each subject
- Import the saved data in EEGLAB (scripts available upon request but not included in this project)
- Allow blinded protocol where data from a session from one subject is used for another subject (the data from the sham subject is recorded as if he was doing the task but the feedback from another subject is shownn).
- Real time Independent Component Analysis
- Real time eLoreta and connectivity analysis. Note that this option is beta and will require that you create a leadfield matrice for your montage and indicate which regions of interest you want to compute connectivity between (use the function eloreta_compute_file_nfblab.m to do so).

# Hardware

Any EEG system supported by LSL (this includes BIOSEMI, EGI, Neuroscan, Brainproducts, Emotiv, Cognionics, Enobio, Muse etc...). See the full list at https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer/wiki/SupportedDevices.wiki. Allow using ADR101 board (http://www.ontrak.net/adr101.htm) if you want to be able to send events from the presentation computer to the EEG system. These boards translate serial information to parallel that can be used with EEG systems. Plan for a relatively powerfull multi-core computer to perform both data acquisition and feedback. The current program was used with a BIOSEMI 64-channel system and a 4-core Dell workstation with 8Gb of RAM.

# Feedback

Visual feedback is handled by the free Matlab Psychophysics toolbox (http://psychtoolbox.org/). Assuming that 2 screens are connected to the same PC, one screen for the experimenter and one screen for the participant. Can also be set up a single screen program that the experimenter and participant share. Default visual feedback is simple (for a session is visible see https://youtu.be/7lrMgpV1FSI) but can be tailored to any user need.

Feedback through a third party program is implemented through TCP/IP communication. An example of client is provided in simple_client.m. To use this client, start 2 sessions of Matlab. Set the nfblab_process  "runmode" parameter to "slave", then run nfblab_process which will then for a connection from a client. In the separate session run the simple_client program. The program connected through TCP/IP can change all the options for the nfblab_process program including the LSL stream name.

# Platform

Tested on Windows, Mac. 

# Publication

This program was used to collect data on 24 subjects in a double blinded protocol (12 neurofeedback and 12 controls). 192 sessions were recorded. An session demo is visible here https://youtu.be/7lrMgpV1FSI. Please cite

# Install the program

See the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) documentation.

# Computer settings
- Set up your screen resolution and screen settings. This program is made to be run on 2 screens, one screen for the subject and one screen for the expertimenter. For technical reasons, it is always better to set your primary screen as the screen for the subject (otherwise the psychophysics toolbox might not work properly).
- Disable visual buffering in Matlab. Create an icon on the desktop for Matlab. Look at properties - compatibility tab. Disable "Desktop composition" and "Disable display scaling on high DPI setttings".
- Go to your graphic card properties (display settings and select your graphic card). If you do not have graphic properties, then do not worry about this step. Disable tripple buferring, double buffering and any other fancy option (3-D etc...).

# Program settings
Program settings are contained in the file [nfblab_options.m](src/nfblab_options.m). Parameters are explained below.

## General parameters
- psychoToolbox (true/false), Toggle to false for testing without psych toolbox
- adrBoard      (true/false), Toggle to true if using ADR101 board to send events to the EEG amplifier

## sessions parameters g.session
- baselineSessionDuration (integer), duration of baseline in second (the baseline is used to train the artifact removal ASR function)
- sessionDuration (integer), regular sessions - here 5 minutes
- ntrials (integer), number of trials per day
- ndays   (integer), number of days of training

## LSL connection parameters g.input
- lsltype (string), put to empty if you cannot connect to your system
- lslname (string), this is the name of the stream that shows in Lab Recorder f empty, it will only use the type above. USE lsl_resolve_byprop(lib, 'type', lsltype, 'name', lslname) to connect to the stream. If you cannot connect nfblab won't be able to connect either.

## data acquisition parameters g.input
- nchans  (integer), number of channels with data
- chans   (integer), indices of channels with data
- mask    (floating point array), patial filter for feedback (here used channel 1). May be an ICA component or complex spatial filter.
- srateHardware (integer), sampling rate of the hardware
- srate         (integer), sampling rate for processing data (must divide srateHardware)
- windowSize (integer), length of window size for FFT (if equal to srate then 1 second)
- windowInc  (integer), window increment - in this case update every 1/4 second

## data processing parameters g.input
- nfft       (integer), length of FFT - allows FFT padding if necessary

## feedback parameters g.feedback
- theta   [min max]. Frequency range of interest. This program does not allow inhibition at other frequencies although it could be modified to do so
- maxChange  (value from 0 to 1). Cap for change in feedback between processed windows every 1/4 sec. feedback is between 0 and 1 so this is 5% here
- dynRange     [min max]. Initial power range in dB
- dynRangeInc  (value from 0 to 1). Increase in dynamical range in percent if the power value is outside the range (every 1/4 sec)
- dynRangeDec  (value from 0 to 1). Decrease in dynamical range in percent if the power value is within the range (every 1/4 sec)

# Compile the program (so it does not require Matlab)
