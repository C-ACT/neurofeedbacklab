These are the different instalation steps.

# Installs
1- On a Windows computer
2- Install Matlab. You may use a student version of Matlab.
3- Install BCILAB https://github.com/sccn/BCILAB and add to Matlab path (go to the root folder and type "bcilab")
4- Install the Psychophysics toolbox http://psychtoolbox.org/download/ (select download ZIP file) (go to the root folder and type "PsychDefaultSetup(2)")
5- Install the Lab Streaming Layer https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer. Familiarize yourself with this tool. You need to be able to connect to your EEG hardware and use the LabRecorder to save data from your hardware, then open and inspect that data under the EEGLAB software (for example).

# Computer settings
5- Set up your screen resolution and screen settings. This program is made to be run on 2 screens, one screen for the subject and one screen for the expertimenter. For technical reasons, it is always better to set your primary screen as the screen for the subject (otherwise the psychophysics toolbox might not work properly).
6- Disable visual buffering in Matlab. Create an icon on the desktop for Matlab. Look at properties - compatibility tab. Disable "Desktop composition" and "Disable display scaling on high DPI setttings".
7- Go to your graphic card properties (display settings and select your graphic card). If you do not have graphic properties, then do not worry about this step. Disable tripple buferring, double buffering and any other fancy option (3-D etc...).
